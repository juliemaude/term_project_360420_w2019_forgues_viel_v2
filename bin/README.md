# Code

Place the code you developped for the term project in this folder. Add any instructions/documentation required to run the code, and what results can be expected in this *README* file.

The official java file that contains the code is the Frisbeev2.java not the Frisbee.java. It contains the latest modifications, but we left the older one as a proof of the work that as been done prior to the final version.
