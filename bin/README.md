# Code

Please note that the official java file that contains the code is the Frisbeev2.java not the Frisbee.java. It contains the latest modifications, but we left the older one as a proof of the work that has been done prior to the final version.

The program allows us to find the distance reached by the frisbee at a specific angle. However, the optimization part of the program is not yet working that is why the part calling the goldensearch in the main is commented.
